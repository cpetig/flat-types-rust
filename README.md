# Vector and String data types for flat representation

This is intended as a proof of concept for
[Flat data representation in the wasm component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/398).

Thus the focus is on the binary data created, API improvements (or even
alternative APIs) are always
welcome and expected to be needed before this gets widely usable.
